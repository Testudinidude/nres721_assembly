In this tutorial, we'll practice assembling RADseq-style data. Our objectives are to:

1) understand the broad strokes of how `ipyrad` assembles data
2) compare results from a de novo and reference-based assembly
3) produce output files for use in downstream analyses

To do this, we'll use a small subset of data from the patch-nosed salamander (*Urspelerpes brucei*). This is a tiny (~ 25 mm) lungless salamander endemic to just ~ 20 km^2^ in Georgia and South Carolina.

Aren't they beautiful? Today, we'll use "RADcap" [(Hoffberg et al. 2016)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.12566) data generated from three individuals each from three populations of this salamander.

We'll first create a new `ipyrad` assembly by typing `ipyrad -n ubrucei`. Let's look at this template `ipyrad` parameters file:

```{bash}
cat ipyrad_files/params-ubrucei.txt
```

...run ipyrad
```{bash}
ipyrad -p params-ubrucei.txt
```
